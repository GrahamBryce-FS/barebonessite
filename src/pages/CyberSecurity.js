            <p>In today's increasingly interconnected world, the importance of cyber security and encryption cannot be overstated. As we rely more on digital technology for communication, transactions, and storing sensitive information, the need to safeguard our data and privacy becomes paramount. Cyber security plays a vital role in protecting individuals, organizations, and even nations from the ever-evolving threats posed by malicious actions. It is honestly a great career field if you are looking into a different field because it will always be forever evolving. For every breakthrough with cybersecurity someone else will be working on a way to break through that.</p>
