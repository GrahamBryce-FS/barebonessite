It's like stepping into a whole new world with special goggles that you wear on your head. The thing is, some of these goggles can be quite big and heavy, which can make them uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. It would be really awesome if they could make the goggles smaller and lighter, so they're more comfortable on our heads. Also, sometimes when we use VR, it can strain our eyes and make them tired. It would be really cool if they could find ways to make VR experiences less tiring for our eyes, so we can enjoy them for longer without any discomfort."))}}}]);
